## Features
### Responsive Grid Layout
- Flexible Design: The grid system ensures that the articles are displayed in a well-organized, adaptable layout. Whether on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the content adjusts gracefully to provide an optimal viewing experience.
- Customizable Columns: Easily adjust the number of columns in the grid to suit your content needs. The SASS setup allows for quick modifications to the column structure without altering the HTML.

### SASS for Efficient Styling
- Modular CSS: SASS enables the use of variables, nested rules, and mixins, making the CSS more maintainable and scalable. This modular approach to styling ensures that changes can be implemented quickly and efficiently.
- Reusable Components: Create reusable style components and utilities with SASS, reducing redundancy and improving the consistency of the design throughout the site.

### Semantic HTML
- Clean Markup: The HTML structure is designed to be semantic, ensuring that the content is not only visually structured but also meaningful and accessible. This enhances SEO performance and improves user experience.
- Accessibility: The use of semantic HTML tags ensures that the website is accessible to users with disabilities, providing a better overall user experience.

### Easy Customization
- Theming: With SASS variables, you can easily change the color scheme, fonts, and other design elements to match your brand or personal preference.
- Extensible: The project is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features or customization of existing ones without disrupting the overall layout and design.

### How It Works
- Grid System: The grid system is built using SASS, defining the breakpoints and column structures. This system ensures that the layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Styling with SASS: Styles are written in SASS, taking advantage of variables, mixins, and nesting to create a maintainable and scalable CSS architecture.
- HTML Structure: Articles are structured in HTML using semantic tags to ensure clarity and accessibility. Each article is placed within grid containers that adapt based on the screen size.
